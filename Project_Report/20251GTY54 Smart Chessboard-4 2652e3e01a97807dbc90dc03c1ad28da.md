2. Wiring Layout
ESP32 (SDA) ---- SDA bus ---- MCP23017 (SDA pins, all 4 chips)
ESP32 (SCL) ---- SCL bus ---- MCP23017 (SCL pins, all 4 chips)
3.3V ---------- VCC (all sensors + MCP23017s)
GND ----------- GND (all sensors + MCP23017s)
Each Hall OUT → MCP23017 input pin
3. Board Design
    
    ![image.png](image%205.png)
    

We have 4 similar PCB’s with the minor difference of address configuration of MCP23017 (IO Expander).

## Electrical Design

From Each PCB, the following pads are present: -

| **5V** | Powers LEDs, Hall Sensors and MCP23017 (IO Expander) |
| --- | --- |
| **GND** | GND |
| **SDA** | SDA Line from MCP to ESP32 for hall input |
| **SCL** | SCL Line from MCP to ESP32 for data sync |
| **DIN** | Output line from ESP for controlling serial LEDs |

Controller Boards:- 

| ESP32 | Raspberry PI 4 (2GB) |
| --- | --- |
| Very fast for real time GPIO handling with very low latency.  | Multiple GPIO handling may lag. |
| Has wifi | Has wifi, but better range |
| Has lower memory (~526KB) | Has higher memory (2GB will be used)
Better for loading chess engine |
| Lower Processing Speed | Higher Processing Speed |
- A hybrid approach is the best here, where esp32 handles the gpio handling, and Raspberry Pi 4 handles the move processing and wifi output.
